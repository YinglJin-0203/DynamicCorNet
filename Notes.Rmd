##  Dynamic MDS

In real dataset, because of the presence of missing value (all missing or missing complete pairs), some correlation measure cannot be calculated at some time slices. In such scenarios, Dynamic penalization become possible, because it is not possible to calculate the difference between configuration. 

We could potentially calculate the difference of nodes that exist in both slices. 

For "empty slices", where no data is available for plot, we could skip this slide and penalize the difference between the two adjacent non-empty slices instead. 

## Splines MDS

- write a function for it

# Improvments

1. Automatically create time index

2. Variable and time slice summary on first page

3.  Smaller label font, transparent nodes

4. normalization:  How to standardize longitudinal data? 

5: Summary: how to summary longtiudinal/non-longitudinal variables? 

5. For now all the variables are still assumed to be numeric. What if we would like to include categorical variables
  - What type of correlation? How to code the values?
  - How to write
